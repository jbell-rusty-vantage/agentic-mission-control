# [CM-14] Context occupancy for Cursor

Status: ready-for-agent — subject to blockers (not published to Linear)

**Owner:** Runtime  
**Wave:** D — Workspaces and fan-out, external signal sources; funding-gated S4 (Daytona, SandboxHost, Model Gateway, self-hosted placements, harnesses on Sandbox Host)  
**Size:** S  
**Sprint:** deferred  
**Blocked by:** CM-02, CM-11  
**Specification:** [SPEC-07-cursor-maturity.md](../SPEC-07-cursor-maturity.md)

## Problem

No occupancy reading, so context pressure never triggers continuation.

## Work

- Occupancy from last run input+cache-read tokens vs model window when known; else unknown with reason; record summary-completed as native compaction.

## Source ownership

Paths are relative to `src/mission_control` unless they begin with `tests/`, `docs/`, `skills/`, `.agents/`, `packages/`, `scripts/` or a root filename. New paths are proposed.

- `adapters/cursor/local.py`
- `adapters/cursor/cloud.py`

## Acceptance

- [ ] Continuation policy triggers on a fixture at the soft ratio.

## Validation and handoff

Run `make check` (or ruff, `uv run mypy`, relevant pytest selections). Persistence and runtime claims need real local PostgreSQL and Temporal. Report passed, failed, blocked and unrun checks separately. No commits, pushes, deployments or paid provider drills without owner authorization. Do not flip `qualified` from fake evidence.

## Provenance

- Owner briefs 2026-10-12 (environment/cognition/observation; API billing approval, hosted API lanes, local CLI skills; remote operation and the AWS thin worker).
- Packet: `docs/specs/archive/materialization-observation-2026-10/` (README, SPRINT, DECISIONS, SPEC-01..11, MANAGED-AGENTS-REMOTE-PATH, research/).
- Baseline: the 2026-10-12 checkpoint on `origin/main` (R19); sharpened the same day (DECISIONS R27-R33).
