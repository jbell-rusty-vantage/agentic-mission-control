# [MO-64] Split-host payload custody preflight

Status: ready-for-agent — subject to blockers (not published to Linear)

**Owner:** Runtime  
**Wave:** B — S0 end to end and Temporal Cloud; Secret Broker; Signal Ingress (SQL, Vercel, drainer) and the remote launch route; lane-only worker and the AWS thin worker; claude_managed prepare, lifecycle, approvals and publication; provider webhooks; data class; Cursor accounting and durability  
**Size:** S  
**Sprint:** in — slice S0 (Local harness path)  
**Blocked by:** None  
**Specification:** [SPEC-09-local-harness-path.md](../SPEC-09-local-harness-path.md)

## Problem

API and workers on different hosts silently use different filesystem payload roots.

## Work

- Preflight compares payload-root identity across API and worker (marker file) and requires S3 when not shared; document the S3 path for remote workers.
- S3 is the payload store whenever the AWS worker is live: S3_BUCKET on the Windows API (profile mission-control) and on the AWS task (task role); AWS_PROFILE must be empty in ECS.

## Source ownership

Paths are relative to `src/mission_control` unless they begin with `tests/`, `docs/`, `skills/`, `.agents/`, `packages/`, `scripts/` or a root filename. New paths are proposed.

- `adapters/temporal/deployment_composition.py`
- `bootstrap/preflight.py`

## Acceptance

- [ ] Preflight flags a non-shared ARTIFACT_PAYLOAD_ROOT; shared /mnt/c root passes.

## Validation and handoff

Run `make check` (or ruff, `uv run mypy`, relevant pytest selections). Persistence and runtime claims need real local PostgreSQL and Temporal. Report passed, failed, blocked and unrun checks separately. No commits, pushes, deployments or paid provider drills without owner authorization. Do not flip `qualified` from fake evidence.

## Provenance

- Owner briefs 2026-10-12 (environment/cognition/observation; API billing approval, hosted API lanes, local CLI skills; remote operation and the AWS thin worker).
- Packet: `docs/specs/archive/materialization-observation-2026-10/` (README, SPRINT, DECISIONS, SPEC-01..11, MANAGED-AGENTS-REMOTE-PATH, research/).
- Baseline: the 2026-10-12 checkpoint on `origin/main` (R19); sharpened the same day (DECISIONS R27-R33).
